# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

This project uses Postgresql v11.14 for sql and pgadmin 4 v5.7 for database creation and query execution. 

### Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this project is to help a fake company Pewlett-Hackard with employee information to investagate possible retiring employees. The data will be imported into a local database using pgadmin 4 and then queries will be performed to organize the data. With the results queries, the number of retiring employees per title will be determined, and employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program will be identified. Then, the results will be summarized.

### Results: 

## Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title

## Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

### Summary: 

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
